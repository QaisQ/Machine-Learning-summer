Here I had to perform Text Mining/Sentiment Analysis for this data. The data contains reviews given for some musical instrument sold in Amazon and the task was to train our machine so that it can, to some extent, understand the sentiment of customer feedbacks, build a model for classifying the feedback as positive,Negative and neutral, and present the important issues the company should focus on.

The second file is a translator built using Text Mining.
